# Herramientas_Computacionales Final Proyect 
## Jos√© Derbez, Joshua Amaya and Alejandro Fernandez

This proyect consists of slight modifications made to 3 differenent Python games taken from "Freegames", and a spooky platformer to conmemorate the spooky season!

Play a new videogame:
  
  Run setup.py
  (Make sure Python is up to date and has the necessary dependencies, if not, it will be installed automatically)

  To run the videogame, you must download a copy of the folder completely, run the program from the main code found in the "game" folder, and start enjoying the game.

  The game controls are as follows:
  
  A <---> D: move sideways
  W: Jump
  S: Shoot

  The player has five fireballs, which recharge with each enemy killed.
  The player has five lives which will be lost one by one if an enemy hits him.
  The game is restarted if the player runs out of health points
